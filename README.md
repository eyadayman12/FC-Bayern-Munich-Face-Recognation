# FC-Bayern-Munich-Face-Recognation

**I have Collected a certain data from google, I collected 100 random pictures of 5 players from Bayern Munich Team, In this Repo, I showed how I collected the data and then applied the Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Feature Scaling and Feature Engineering to it and then modeling using Machine and deep Learning Algorithms**<br><br>

**So Our data is Classification Problem, We have 5 Classes:**<br>
***Class 0 -> Kingsely Coman***<br>

***Class 1 -> Joshua Kimmich***<br>

***Class 3 -> Manuel Neuer***<br>
